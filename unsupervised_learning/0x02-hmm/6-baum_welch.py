    Args:
        Observations is a numpy.ndarray of shape (T,) that contains the index
                     of the observation
                    - T is the number of observations
        Transition is a numpy.ndarray of shape (M, M) that contains the
                   initialized transition probabilities
                   - M is the number of hidden states
        Emission is a numpy.ndarray of shape (M, N) that contains the
                 initialized emission probabilities
                 - N is the number of output states
        Initial is a numpy.ndarray of shape (M, 1) that contains the
                initialized starting probabilities
        iterations is the number of times expectation-maximization should be
                   performed

    Returns: the converged Transition, Emission, or None, None on failure
