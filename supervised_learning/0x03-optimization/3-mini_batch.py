    '''trains a loaded neural network model using mini-batch gradient descent
    Args:
        X_train is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, 784) containing the training
                data
            m is the number of data points
            784 is the number of input features
        Y_train is a one-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (m, 10) containing the
                training labels
            10 is the number of classes the model should classify
        X_valid is a numpy.ndarray of shape (m, 784) containing the validation
                data
        Y_valid is a one-hot numpy.ndarray of shape (m, 10) containing the
                validation labels
        batch_size is the number of data points in a batch
        epochs is the number of times the training should pass through the
               whole dataset
        load_path is the path from which to load the model
        save_path is the path to where the model should be saved after training
    Returns: the path where the model was saved

    Important:
    The model loaded from load_path will have the following tensors / ops saved
        in itâ€™s collection:
        x is a placeholder for the input data
        y is a placeholder for the labels
        accuracy is an op to calculate the accuracy of the model
        loss is an op to calculate the cost of the model
        train_op is an op to perform one pass of gradient descent on the model
